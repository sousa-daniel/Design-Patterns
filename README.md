# Design-Patterns

This repository contains some of the design patterns I studied in University.

This repository is the upload of a folder containing some of the Design Patterns I studied in university.

This [Design Patterns](./src/DesignPatterns.md) file contains a small description for each DP, code blocks with my commentary and links to the source code.

This small collection of examples allowed me to grasp the purpose of each design pattern and some of their practical applications.
